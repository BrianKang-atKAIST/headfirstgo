This is my first study on GoLang.
I don't know how far I can go with Go, but I planned to finish making interpreter with Go before March.
I read that Go is very good language for making webs and dealing with concurrency problem.
Since I had big problem solving those while making web for GRAFFITI festival, so I got huge question about Go.
Long introduction, but worth recording about it.
Good luck for you, also for me.
